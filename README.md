# Excel-to-HTML Table Converter

Convert Excel spreadsheets into clean, copyable HTML tables — with selectable formatting options and instant preview.

**Live application:** [https://evperkinsjr.github.io/excel-to-html-converter/](https://evperkinsjr.github.io/excel-to-html-converter/)

## 🌟 Overview

This tool helps users upload an `.xlsx` file, extract data, and convert it into an HTML table with optional styling. Whether you're preparing documentation, prototyping UI elements, or sharing structured data on the web, this converter provides a quick and accessible way to generate readable, standards-friendly tables.

Built with modular JavaScript and styled with [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/), the application also offers scoped integration of [USWDS](https://designsystem.digital.gov/) for developers working on U.S. federal projects.

> *Note: Preview sorting is powered by the USWDS library and only works within the app. Exported HTML is static unless you include your own table-sorting JavaScript.*

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/excel-to-html-converter.git
cd excel-to-html-converter
```

### 2. Open in Live Server

This project requires a local server due to browser restrictions when reading files. If you use VS Code:

1. Install the **Live Server** extension.
2. Right-click `index.html` → `Open with Live Server`.

> Alternatively, host via Python, Node.js, or deploy to GitHub Pages.

## 🧠 Design Principles

- **User First**: Clear guidance and guardrails for non-technical users
- **Separation of Concerns**: Modular JS, styling isolation (scoped USWDS), and graceful degradation
- **Accessibility by Default**: Structured navigation, focus control, and notification support
- **Deployment-Ready**: Lightweight, portable, and hostable as a static app

---

## 🛠 Deployment

This app is designed to run as a **static site**, making it ideal for:
- [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/)
- [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/)
- [Vercel](https://vercel.com/)

**GitHub Pages instructions**:
1. Push your project to a GitHub repository
2. Go to `Settings > Pages`
3. Select the `main` branch and `/root` as the source
4. Save and deploy

The live site will be available at:
```
https://your-username.github.io/excel-to-html-converter/
```

## 📌 Notes

- Sorting is limited to the preview area. To enable sorting in production, include a table library or the [USWDS JS bundle](https://designsystem.digital.gov/documentation/developers/#javascript).
- Some advanced table features (like search or filtering) may require custom JS depending on your deployment environment.
